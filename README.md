## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a senior Computer Science student with a passion for solving problems through clean, efficient code. I love exploring everything from algorithms and data structures to full-stack web development and machine learning. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me tinkering with side projects or learning about emerging tech. Excited to collaborate on open-source and learn from fellow developers!
